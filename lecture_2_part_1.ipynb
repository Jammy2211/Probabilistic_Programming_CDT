    "This project uses the astrophysical phenomena of Strong Gravitational Lensing to illustrate multi-level model\n",
    "composition and fitting with **PyAutoFit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong gravitational lens is a system where two (or more) galaxies align perfectly down our line of sight from Earth\n",
    "such that the foreground galaxy's mass deflects the light of a background source galaxy(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the alignment is just right and the lens is massive enough, the background source galaxy appears multiple\n",
    "times. The schematic below shows such a system, where light-rays from the source are deflected around the lens galaxy\n",
    "to the observer following multiple distinct paths.\n",
    "\n",

    "https://www.astro.caltech.edu/~george/qsolens/\n",
    "\n",
    "As an observer, we don't see the source's true appearance (e.g. as the red round blob of light). Instead, we only\n",
    "observe its light after it has been deflected and lensed by the foreground galaxies (e.g. as the two distinct\n",
    "red multiple images in the image on the left). We will of course also see the emission of the foreground\n",
    "galaxy (in blue).\n",

    "\n",
    "__PyAutoLens__\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong gravitational lensing is the original science case that sparked the development of **PyAutoFit**, which is\n",
    "a spin off of our astronomy software **PyAutoLens** `https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **PyAutoLens** to illustrate how the tools we developed with **PyAutoFit** allowed us to\n",
    "ensure **PyAutoLens**'s code-base was extensible and easy to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Multi-Level Models__\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong lensing is a great case study for using **PyAutoFit**, due to the multi-component nature of how one composes\n",
    "a strong lens model. To model a strong lens, one needs to model the light and mass of each galaxy in the system,\n",
    "where each galaxy is a model in itself, and the galaxies are combined into one overall \"lens model\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This example project uses **PyAutoFit** to compose and fit models of a strong lens, in particular highlighting\n",
    "**PyAutoFits** multi-level model composition. I recommend you check out the following description of this feature on\n",
    "our readthedocs first, which uses this strong lensing example to give a high-level overview of multi-level models:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graphical/composition.html\n",
    "\n",
    "__Strong Lens Modeling__\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are fitted to Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a real strong lens system and will allow us to come up\n",
    "with a description of how light is deflected on its path through the Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project consists of two example scripts / notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1) `section_1_intro`: An introduction to strong lensing, and the various parts of the project's source code that are\n",
    " used to represent a strong lens galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2) `section_2_multi_level_model`: Using **PyAutoFit** to model a strong lens, with a strong emphasis on the\n",
    " multi-level model API.\n",

    "Note that import `import src as astro`. The package `src` contains all the code we need for this example Astronomy\n",
    "use case, and can be thought of as the source-code you would write to perform model-fitting via **PyAutoFit**. The\n",
