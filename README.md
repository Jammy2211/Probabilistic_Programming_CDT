# Durham CDT Data Science Workshop

Probabilistic Programming Lectures for the CDT Workshop September 13-17 2021 Durham

These lectures use the probabilistic programming language **PyAutoFit** (https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit).

**Probabilistic Programming 1: Fitting a Model to Data**

In this lecture, you will learn how to compose a probabilistic model and perform inference on data by defining a 
likelihood function, which is sampled using a non-linear search algorithm.

**Probabilistic Programming 2: Application To Astronomy**

This lecture uses strong gravitational lensing to demonstrate how adopting a probabilistic programming language can 
benefit scientific research and shows advanced model composition using multi-level models can create an extensible and
easy to maintain code base.
