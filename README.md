# Durham University STFC CDT Data Science Workshop

Probabilistic Programming Lectures for the STFC CDT Workshop (September 13-17 2021) hosted by Durham University.

These lectures use the probabilistic programming language **PyAutoFit** (https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit).

**Probabilistic Programming 1: Fitting a Model to Data**

In this lecture, you will learn how to compose a probabilistic model and perform inference on data by defining a 
likelihood function, which is sampled using a non-linear search algorithm.

The slides for this section can be viewed at the following link (part 1 is covered between the first slide and the 
slide title "Cosmology: Strong Gravitational Lensing"):

**Probabilistic Programming 2: Application To Astronomy**

This lecture uses strong gravitational lensing to demonstrate how adopting a probabilistic programming language can 
benefit scientific research and shows advanced model composition using multi-level models can create an extensible and
easy to maintain code base.

The slides for this section can be viewed at the following link (part 2 is covered between the slide title "Cosmology: 
Strong Gravitational Lensing" and "PyAutoFit: Advanced Features"):
